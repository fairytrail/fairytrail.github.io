 <br>&nbsp;<br>
Fairytrail hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Suppliers. Fairytrail is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such content. Since Fairytrail has no control over the Products and does not verify the changes made by the Travel Suppliers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the information displayed on Fairytrail Properties.

Fairytrail urges passengers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States Government and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Please read this section very carefully as it describes what the process is if there is a dispute between you and Fairytrail; if you are unsure as to any portion of this, you can contact us and/or seek legal advice.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If a dispute arises under the terms of this Agreement or as a result of any activities related to the App. or this Agreement, then the complaining party must do the following:
<br>&nbsp;<br>
1).  Communicate in detail in any written fashion to Fairytrail the nature of the complaint, including but not limited to, the date of any incident and location, the names and addresses if known of anyone or entity that contributed to the problem, exact details of what occurred, suggested remedies if any, the nature and approximate value of any damages suffered, and any other information that might help solve the problem.
2). All sides will attempt in good faith to resolve the issues or as many as can be resolved that are involved.
3). During the period of time until resolution, the customer will not use any of the services of Fairytrail and their subscription will be held in abeyance, unless Fairytrail agrees to waive the suspension.  If no further action is taken, after 60 days Fairytrails may fully terminate the customer’s membership and retain any unused portion of the membership fees as liquidated damages.
4).  If within 30 days of the receipt of the complaint the party requesting the action is not satisfied with the other side’s proposals, then the following can be done:
a) File civil suit in Alameda County Superior or Small Claims Court, California,as that County will be considered the only place for jurisdiction for any civil suit.  The court branch where suit will be heard, subject to court rules, will be where the injury occurred if in Alameda County, or if not in Alameda County, then at the Fremont Branch California.
b) All parties will be subject to the applicable Alameda County court rules and the California Rules of Court.
c) Customer or user waives any right to be a member of a class action suit as each dispute is considered unique to each customer or user.
d) If the Superior Court should insist upon arbitration or mediation of the dispute, then both sides agree they will bear their own costs and equally split the costs of arbitration and/or mediation with plaintiff paying one half and all defendants cumulatively paying the other 50%.  Plaintiff further agrees not to add such costs to their settlement demand.  All parties will bear their own litigation expenses, including attorney fees, except to the extent permitted by court rules.  By mutual agreement, the parties can waive any portion of the above terms.
e) Both sides agree to waive their rights to a jury trial [including any appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment] as setting a case for a jury trial results in much greater costs and delays in time to resolve the matter.
f) Both sides agree that any judgment can be entered in any other court in the USA or other country, pursuant to the rules of such court.
g) No claim or demand by a customer or user can be consolidated with the claim or demand of another customer or user.
h) All judgments or settlements are to remain confidential and a separate confidentiality agreement [non-disclosure agreement] will be entered into without additional payment.
i) When and where possible, no suit shall be brought in Federal Court.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Severability. If any part or parts of this Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
