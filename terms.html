<p>Welcome to Fairytrail! We’re excited you’re here and look forward to helping you find your next date, relationship, and adventure.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
The following ‘Terms of Service’ are a binding contractual commitment (“Agreement”). We recommend reading it in full before using our service, but the most important point is this: your safety is our top priority. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
For your safety, we reserve to right to remove any user for a number of reasons, but most importantly if we believe they are acting inappropriately or misrepresenting themselves. If someone has made you uncomfortable for any reason, please report them to our customer support team, either via the app or by emailing support@fairytrail.app. 
</p>

      <center><h3>TERMS OF SERVICE</h3></center>

 <br>&nbsp;<br>
 We reserve the right to modify, amend, or change the Terms at any time. Notice of any material change will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. In certain circumstances, we may notify you of a change to the Terms via email or other means, as appropriate under the circumstances; however, you are responsible for regularly checking this page for notice of any changes.

The Service may include various opportunities that enable you to message, post information, provide feedback, recommendations, reviews, and comments, and otherwise interact with other users, either through postings or by interacting in real time (together with Fairytrail social media properties, referred to as “Messaging, Forums, and Social Media”). With respect to any and all Messaging, Forums, and Social Media, the following restrictions and obligations apply: 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
We will have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor or review any Messaging, Forums, and Social Media at any time for any violation of these Terms or illegal content. Fairytrail will have no liability to you for any content posted in Messaging, Forums, and Social Media. You acknowledge that any opinions, statements, recommendations, offers, advice or other information presented or disseminated on the Messaging, Forums, and Social Media are those of their respective authors who are solely responsible and liable for their content.

</p>
<center><h3> IN-APP PURCHASES AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTIONS</h3></center>
<p>
You will have the opportunity to purchase products and services from Fairytrail. If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew—and you will be charged—until you cancel.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Fairytrail may offer products and services for purchase through iTunes/App Store, Google Play or other external services authorized by Fairytrail (each, an “External Service,” and any purchases made thereon, an “External Service Purchase”). If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew until you cancel, in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase, as further described below. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your subscription benefits until the end of your subscription period, at which point is will expire.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Because our Services may be utilized without a subscription, canceling your subscription does not remove your profile from our Services. If you wish to fully terminate your membership, you must terminate your membership.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
External Service Purchases, including subscriptions, may be processed through the External Service, in which case those purchases must be managed through your External Service Account. Subscriptions automatically renew until you cancel.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
When making a purchase on the Service, you may have the option to pay through an External Service, such as with your Apple ID or Google account (“your External Service Account”), and your External Service Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms applicable to your External Service Account. Some External Services may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live, which may change from time to time.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If your External Service Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your External Service Account will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, the subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period you agreed to when subscribing.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
To cancel a subscription: If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your External Service Account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the App from your device. For example, if you subscribed using your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by Apple, not Fairytrail. To cancel a purchase made with your Apple ID, go to Settings > iTunes & App Stores > [click on your Apple ID] > View Apple ID > Subscriptions, then find your Fairytrail subscription and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at https://getsupport.apple.com. Similarly, if you subscribed on Google Play, cancellation is handled by Google. To cancel a purchase made through Google Play, launch the Google Play app on your mobile device and go to Menu > My Apps > Subscriptions, then find your Fairytrail subscription and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at https://play.google.com. If you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use the cancelled service until the end of your then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your External Service Account, Fairytrail may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion. Fairytrail will retain all funds charged to your External Service Account until you cancel your subscription through your External Service Account. Certain users may be entitled to request a refund.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
We may make certain products and/or services available to users of the App in consideration of fees (“Premium Services”), including the ability to purchase products, services and enhancements (“In-App Products”). If you choose to use Premium Services or purchase In-App Products, you acknowledge and agree that additional terms may apply to your use of, access to and purchase of such Premium Services and In-App Products, and such additional terms are incorporated herein by reference.

With respect to any and all Messaging, Forums, and Social Media, the following restrictions and obligations apply: 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
By accessing or using Fairytrail Properties in any manner, you agree to be bound by the Agreement and represent that you have read and understood its terms. If you do not accept all of these terms and conditions, please do not access Fairytrail Properties or book a Product. In all booking arrangements, the person making the booking shall be deemed to have accepted this Agreement on behalf of the persons named in the booking.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>We Do Not Sell Travel Products</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Fairytrail does not provide, own, warrant, vouch for, monitor, or control any of the travel services and products that you can access through Fairytrail Properties, such as tours, flights, accommodations,  packages, or travel insurance (the “Travel Products”). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the “Travel Suppliers ”) either directly (e.g., airline) or through a travel agency. The Travel Suppliers are responsible for the Products. The Travel Suppliers’ terms and privacy policies apply to your booking so you must agree to and understand those terms. The terms of the actual travel supplier (airline, hotel, tour operator, etc.) apply to your travel, so you must also agree to and understand those terms. Your interaction with any Travel Supplier accessed through Fairytrail Properties is at your own risk; Fairytrail does not bear any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking or during your travel.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The display on Fairytrail Properties of Products or Travel Suppliers does not—in any way—imply, suggest, or constitute a recommendation by Fairytrail of that Product or Travel Supplier, or any sponsorship or approval of Fairytrail by such Travel Supplier, or any affiliation between such Travel Suppliers and Fairytrail. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
We take no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Content posted, stored or uploaded by you or any third party, or for any loss or damage thereto, nor is Fairytrail liable for any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity you may encounter. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Products and Bookings</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
By booking a reservation for a Product through the Service, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement, use the Fairytrail Properties, book the Product, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will make only legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorized to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Payments and Refunds</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Fairytrail may take reservation deposits and payments for the Products by deducting funds from your travel money balance, but the sale of the Product is made by InteleTravel.com. Fairytrail reserves the right to charge a service fee for referring you to InteleTravel.com.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
You may increase your travel money balance by referring users, taking specific actions in the app, and purchasing it directly. Travel money is Fairytrail store credit that can be used for booking tours, flights, accommodations, and other goods/services. Travel money cannot be refunded or withdrawn as cash. Travel money does not expire. If your account is deleted, your travel money will be forfeited and cannot be reinstated as all data are deleted. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
When you and your partner both request to book travel, we will take the payment from both travel money accounts. If your travel money balance is insufficient to cover the cost of the booking, we will ask you to purchase enough travel money to cover the costs. Only when both parties have travel money balances that can cover their own booking costs, will we process the booking and will the tickets be issued. This allows both parties to be assured knowing their partner has also booked the trip.
 <br>&nbsp;<br>
The cancellation and refund policies of the Products are determined by InteleTravel.com and Travel Suppliers, not Fairytrail and Fairytrail has no authority or involvement regarding this. In the event of a refund, the funds will be returned to your travel money balance.
 <br>&nbsp;<br>
Fairytrail hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Suppliers. Fairytrail is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such content. Since Fairytrail has no control over the Products and does not verify the changes made by the Travel Suppliers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the information displayed on Fairytrail Properties. Prices change constantly and additional charges (e.g., payment fees, services charges, checked-in luggage fees, local taxes, and fees) may apply.

Fairytrail accepts no liability for travelers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
We strongly recommend that you purchase a comprehensive travel insurance policy prior to departure to protect your Product purchase.

Fairytrail urges passengers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States Government and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
1).  Communicate in detail in any written fashion to Fairytrail the nature of the complaint, including but not limited to, the date of any incident and location, the names and addresses if known of anyone or entity that contributed to the problem, exact details of what occurred, suggested remedies if any, the nature and approximate value of any damages suffered, and any other information that might help solve the problem.
2). All sides will attempt in good faith to resolve the issues or as many as can be resolved that are involved.
3). During the period of time until resolution, the customer will not use any of the services of Fairytrail and their subscription will be held in abeyance, unless Fairytrail agrees to waive the suspension.  If no further action is taken, after 60 days Fairytrails may fully terminate the customer’s membership and retain any unused portion of the membership fees as liquidated damages.
4).  If within 30 days of the receipt of the complaint the party requesting the action is not satisfied with the other side’s proposals, then the following can be done:
a) File civil suit in Alameda County Superior or Small Claims Court, California,as that County will be considered the only place for jurisdiction for any civil suit.  The court branch where suit will be heard, subject to court rules, will be where the injury occurred if in Alameda County, or if not in Alameda County, then at the Fremont Branch California.
b) All parties will be subject to the applicable Alameda County court rules and the California Rules of Court.
c) Customer or user waives any right to be a member of a class action suit as each dispute is considered unique to each customer or user.

By mutual agreement, the parties can waive any portion of the above terms.

g) No claim or demand by a customer or user can be consolidated with the claim or demand of another customer or user.
