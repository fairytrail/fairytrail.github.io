      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Submission Guidelines</h2>
      <br>&nbsp;<br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Before you write a blog post for Fairytrail Stories, you must submit an outline of your post. This is to ensure that your post gets published. The last thing we want you to do is to spend a TON of time and energy on a blog post that does not meet our approval.
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        Below is a breakdown of a typical blog post structure. Please follow a similar format when creating your outline. 
        <br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>
        Simply email vikas@fairytrail.app an outline of your proposed blog post in a similar format shown below.  You can either list bullet points for each section or write short, descriptive paragraphs.
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        1. Title - The post title is the most important part of the post.  Create a title that will get people to click on it!
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        2. Introduction – In order to draw the reader in after an amazing title, an introduction should really make the reader WANT to continue on and read then entire post.
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        3. “The Meat” – This is the area of the blog post that contains the value for our readers. We always stress this: Give our readers value. We want them to get inspired after they read your post. The “Meat” might be broken down into several sections. Please list each sub-section and describe what they will be about.
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        4. Conclusion – Simply conclude what you are trying to explain in your post.
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        5. Signature – This is where you can talk a little about yourself and give yourself a link or two.
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        6. Images – Images are very important for our blog posts. Images must be clean and sized to 600px. Both .jpg and .png formats are acceptable (no .gif). You do not need to include images in your outline. They are required for your final draft. However, please include captions for each image in your final draft.
        <br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>
        <b><u>Notes regarding your final draft</u>:</b> First turn in your outline and wait for the approval. If your post gets approved please turn in your final draft as a Google Doc with your images attached to your email. Notes regarding backlinks: Do not sneak keywords that link back to your website. It makes the post look spammy and unprofessional. Your signature is where you get to link back.
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        Usually, within 48 hours, we will reply stating if we will accept the guest post or not. If we reject your post, you are obviously free to use it in your own blog or to propose it as a guest post to some other website.
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        We look forward to hearing from you!
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
